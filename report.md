# Report

## Overview
Overall, we found that our models predicted healthy loans perfectly and that they predicted high risk loans fairly accurately, with `f1-score`s close to 1.00. The model with over-sampled data predicted high-risk loans a little bit more accurately than it did without over-sampled data. 

## Accuracy, Precision, and Recall
<!-- how often the model is correctâ€”the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total number of observations. 
(TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) -->
* accuracy - 
<!-- the ratio of correctly
predicted positive observations to the
total predicted positive observations. 
TP / (TP + FP) -->
* precision - 
<!-- the ratio of correctly
predicted positive observations to all
predicted observations for that class. 
TP / (TP + FN) -->
* recall - 

## Recommendation
I would recommend this model for use by the company since it perfectly predicts healthy loans and predicts high-risk loans fairly accurately, with `f1-score`s that are close to 1.00.
